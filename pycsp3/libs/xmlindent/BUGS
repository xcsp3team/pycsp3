	BUGS

The current version has the following known bugs and limitations:

  - Attributes inside start-tags and empty element tags are not indented.
  - The scanner trips over on characters that are not part of 7-bit ASCII
    (ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8, for example, don't work correctly).
  - Comments are not formatted.
